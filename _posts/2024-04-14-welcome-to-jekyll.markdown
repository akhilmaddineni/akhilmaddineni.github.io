<!-- You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Hello Everyone ! Finally the blog is real and it’s here. More than 5 years into my professional Journey and I have been incessantly talking about starting a blog with my internet friends for years but looks like I have finally pulled the trigger and done it. 

Blog will mostly about Embedded systems, RF systems, Wireless communication, Compilers and commentary on contemporary Art, Music and Film and random thoughts about life. It might be all over the place but writing really helps and I might as well put my thoughts out there into the void. 

Happy reading!
